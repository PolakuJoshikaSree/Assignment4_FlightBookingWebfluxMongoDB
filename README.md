## 📊 Aggregation Pipelines (MongoDB)
The project demonstrates real-world analytics using MongoDB pipelines:

- ✔️ **Total Revenue per Flight**  
- ✔️ **Passenger Count per Flight**  
- ✔️ **Daily Booking Count**  
- ✔️ **Seats Booked per Flight**  
- ✔️ **Remaining Seats per Flight**  

These pipelines provide insights for airline operations and reporting dashboards.
